# Quantum Architecture Description Language (QADL)

## Overview

Quantum Architecture Description Language (QADL) is a formal language for representing the architecture of quantum computing systems. It provides a structured approach to describing different aspects of quantum systems, such as quantum gates, qubits, channels, buses, states, and subsystems. QADL allows users to describe both the logical and physical structure of quantum systems using a clear and standardized syntax.

QADL is useful for documenting quantum systems, designing quantum software architectures, and modeling quantum algorithms across different quantum platforms.

## Features

- **Structural View**: Describes the basic components of a quantum system such as qubits, quantum gates, quantum channels, quantum buses, and quantum subsystems.
- **Computational View**: Focuses on the computational elements of quantum systems, detailing quantum algorithms and their operations on qubits.
- **Physical View**: Describes the physical implementation of quantum components, such as hardware and physical systems.
- **Integration View**: Represents how various components of the quantum system are connected and interact with each other.

## Syntax

QADL syntax is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. It uses a simple, human-readable format for representing quantum components and their relationships.

Hereâ€™s an example of a **StructuralView** in QADL:

```text
@startQADL
StructuralView {
    Qubit q0
    Qubit q1
    QuantumGate Hadamard on q0
    QuantumGate CNOT on q0 q1
    QuantumChannel channel1 from q0 to q1
    QuantumBus bus1 connecting q0 and q1
    QuantumState state1 on q0
    QuantumSubsystem subsystem1 managing q0 q1
}
